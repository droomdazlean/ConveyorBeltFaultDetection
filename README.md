# ConveyorBeltFaultDetection

1.3	PROBLEM STATEMENT
The industry of mining platinum group metals in Zimbabwe faces challenges of low plant utilization due to optimization inefficiencies and traditional maintenance strategies which have a negative effect on mining organizations reputation, profitability and the economy of Zimbabwe at large.
 
1.4	AIM
Use of an artificial intelligence model integrated with prognostics and health management to improve mean time between failure (MTBF) of conveyor belt systems in the mining of platinum group metals in Zimbabwe, thereby predicting remaining useful life (RUL) for mining organizations and hence profitability.

1.5	OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives are as follows:
•	To design and implement an artificial intelligence (AI) model that predicts failure of conveyor belt systems for platinum group metals mining organizations in Zimbabwe.
•	To heighten mean time before failure (MTBF) of conveyor belt systems and thereby increasing overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) and plant utilization by a minimum of 5%.
•	To develop an artificial intelligence (AI) driven predictive maintenance scheduling system that optimizes maintenance actions and reducing unplanned conveyor belt system outages with a minimum of 5%.

1.6	JUSTIFICATION
Most organizations in Zimbabwe fail to sustain the standard operating conditions of equipment or systems due to the operating conditions in Zimbabwe and the adopted maintenance procedures by the organizations. This leads to problems such as lower plant throughput and increased maintenance related operating expenditure due to outages such as unplanned breakdowns. Optimizing maintenance execution by eliminating most of unplanned breakdowns has a positive effect of increasing operational efficiency and profitability of an organization, this is one of the main objectives. Increasing return on investment and giving organizations a competitive edge in global marketing, by also reducing high foreign currency outflows due to reduced emergency imports of spare parts is also another basis. Another rationale is the heightening of overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) in organizations.
